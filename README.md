# Open-CV--Week-1
Open CV (Computer Vision) is done via Python bindings for computer vision and image processing.
<br>
It is installed using pip
<br>

It works as
<br>
Image and Video Processing: Reading, writing, displaying images and videos, resizing, cropping, rotating, color space conversions (e.g., BGR to grayscale), image filtering (blurring, sharpening), edge detection (e.g., Canny), and more.
<br>
✅Object Detection and Recognition: Face detection, object recognition using pre-trained models or custom training, object tracking.
<br>
✅Feature Extraction: Detecting and describing key points and features in images for tasks like image matching and panorama stitching.
<br>
✅Machine Learning: Basic machine learning algorithms integrated within the library.
<br>
✅Camera Calibration: Correcting for lens distortions and calibrating camera parameters.
